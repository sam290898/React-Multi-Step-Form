In this repository you will find 4 step form, where the first two steps are input fields for the form.
the third step shows all the data entries by the user. The last step displays the message that entries are stored. 

The form entries are intact even if user jumps from one page to another.

Note : the project only shows the front end side. the back end part is not included in this repository.
